	abstract = {The goal of this study is to develop a prediction method to recognize the wake field behind a ship using a convolutional neural network ({CNN}) model. First, a new representation method for a 3D curved surface is proposed suitable for the {CNN}, called an image-based hull form representation ({IHR}). The advantages of the proposed method are the high fidelity of its hull form representation using more than 20,000 input data points and its fast prediction speed, which requires less than 0.01 s for a task that traditionally took more than an hour to estimate by physics-based simulation. The {IHR} regards that a two-dimensional grid formed on the 3D curved hull surface, which is used for structured-grid-based {CFD}, as a data set with the same data structure as the image data. Because {CNNs} recognize image data at accuracy rates higher than humans, a {CNN} is also be expected to recognize 3D surface characteristics with higher accuracy than humans. The image data are represented by three primary colors (cyan, magenta, yellow) in vertical and horizontal (i × j) pixels. The hull-form-structured grid can also be expressed as an i × j structure data with (x, y, z) coordinates that have the same data structure as the three primary colors in the image data. A {CFD} calculation data set of 2730 ship types with different stern shapes was constructed to verify the proposed method. The validation results proves that the root mean squared error of the proposed model is 0.005 to predict axial wake velocity on a propeller plane, and the coefficient of determination R2 achieves 0.986. In addition, the estimation speed for each hull-form prediction is 100,000 times faster than are physics-based simulations. The results lead to the conclusion that the representation method of a curved surface and the proposed prediction method of the stern wake field is a promising tool in the initial hull form design.},

	abstract = {Most cases of successfully designed hull forms developed using conventional nonlinear optimization methods propose the optimal candidates in a particular design constraint. Furthermore, these optimal designs contain uncertainties in terms of the evaluation parameters and design conditions, thereby raising the issue of robustness of the design idea that the designer needs to investigate to arrive at a decision for building the expensive structure of a ship. This paper proposes a method to organize and visualize the propulsive performance of any number of hull form combinations. The shape morphing technique, which has been limited to the blending of two or three hull forms, is extended to the shape morphing of N hull forms by introducing the concept of the barycentric coordinate system. Thus, a hull-form coordinate system with each hull form as a basis is proposed. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by analyzing several hull-form design spaces. This method can contribute to improving the robustness of the optimal solution obtained by nonlinear optimization and machine learning, by analyzing and visualizing the design space around the optimal point.},

	abstract = {Hydrodynamic simulation of marine structures is a complex and time-consuming task that requires large, refined models to accurately estimate the behavior of ships. During the conceptual phase, therefore, these estimations may be more efficient if done with a mix of surrogate models and simplified simulations. We believe that {AI} and the web environment can contribute to providing a more precise answer and fast solution, especially when the design domain can be narrowed and properly estimated. This paper shows an attempt in this direction, describing a web-based real-time flow simulator that is composed of a Tenforflow.js-based convolutional neural network model with an image-based hull form representation. Some case studies demonstrate the advantages of a novel web-based prototyping environment in the conceptual and initial design of ships. The image-based hull form representation method with a convolutional neural network enables the design of not only main dimensions but also local shapes in an interactive web-based concurrent engineering environment. Our approach extends the neural network model of wake flow estimation to models of the prediction of resistance and pressure distributions on the hull surface and develops a novel web-based prototyping environment for the conceptual and initial design of ships.},

While generative machine learning methods, which can directly produce design outputs such as the 3D hull form, have the potential to transform the design strategy, ship design inherently involves a decision-making process that requires consensus among stakeholders based on a foundation in physics-based simulations/models. This paper proposes a practical design strategy that positions physics-based simulations/models at the core of the design process, augmented by data-driven models. The paper first classifies hybrid types of the two models and integrates them into a practical design process. Finally, it demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed design approach by showcasing the impact of data circulation, which accumulates and reinforces data in day-to-day design operations, on improving design outcomes.},

To fill this gap, we present {AutoDev}, a fully automated {AI}-driven software development framework, designed for autonomous planning and execution of intricate software engineering tasks. {AutoDev} enables users to define complex software engineering objectives, which are assigned to {AutoDev}'s autonomous {AI} Agents to achieve. These {AI} agents can perform diverse operations on a codebase, including file editing, retrieval, build processes, execution, testing, and git operations. They also have access to files, compiler output, build and testing logs, static analysis tools, and more. This enables the {AI} Agents to execute tasks in a fully automated manner with a comprehensive understanding of the contextual information required. Furthermore, {AutoDev} establishes a secure development environment by confining all operations within Docker containers. This framework incorporates guardrails to ensure user privacy and file security, allowing users to define specific permitted or restricted commands and operations within {AutoDev}. In our evaluation, we tested {AutoDev} on the {HumanEval} dataset, obtaining promising results with 91.5\% and 87.8\% of Pass@1 for code generation and test generation respectively, demonstrating its effectiveness in automating software engineering tasks while maintaining a secure and user-controlled development environment.},

	abstract = {In this work, we introduce {ShipHullGAN}, a generic parametric modeller built using deep convolutional generative adversarial networks ({GANs}) for the versatile representation and generation of ship hulls. At a high level, the new model intends to address the current conservatism in the parametric ship design paradigm, where parametric modellers can only handle a particular ship type. We trained {ShipHullGAN} on a large dataset of 52,591 physically validated designs from a wide range of existing ship types, including container ships, tankers, bulk carriers, tugboats, and crew supply vessels. We developed a new shape extraction and representation strategy to convert all training designs into a common geometric representation of the same resolution, as typically {GANs} can only accept vectors of fixed dimension as input. A space-filling layer is placed right after the generator component to ensure that the trained generator can cover all design classes. During training, designs are provided in the form of a shape-signature tensor ({SST}) which harnesses the compact geometric representation using geometric moments that further enable the inexpensive incorporation of physics-informed elements in ship design. We have shown through extensive comparative studies and optimisation cases that {ShipHullGAN} can generate designs with augmented features resulting in versatile design spaces that produce traditional and novel designs with geometrically valid and practically feasible shapes.

	abstract = {Autonomous driving technology, a catalyst for revolutionizing transportation and urban mobility, has the tend to transition from rule-based systems to data-driven strategies. Traditional module-based systems are constrained by cumulative errors among cascaded modules and inflexible pre-set rules. In contrast, end-to-end autonomous driving systems have the potential to avoid error accumulation due to their fully data-driven training process, although they often lack transparency due to their "black box" nature, complicating the validation and traceability of decisions. Recently, large language models ({LLMs}) have demonstrated abilities including understanding context, logical reasoning, and generating answers. A natural thought is to utilize these abilities to empower autonomous driving. By combining {LLM} with foundation vision models, it could open the door to open-world understanding, reasoning, and few-shot learning, which current autonomous driving systems are lacking.

	abstract = {Abstract. Concept generation is a creative step in the conceptual design phase, where designers often turn to brainstorming, mindmapping, or crowdsourcing design ideas to complement their own knowledge of the domain. Recent advances in natural language processing ({NLP}) and machine learning ({ML}) have led to the rise of Large Language Models ({LLMs}) capable of generating seemingly creative outputs from textual prompts. The success of these models has led to their integration and application across a variety of domains, including art, entertainment, and other creative work. In this paper, we leverage {LLMs} to generate solutions for a set of 12 design problems and compare them to a baseline of crowdsourced solutions. We evaluate the differences between generated and crowdsourced design solutions through multiple perspectives, including human expert evaluations and computational metrics. Expert evaluations indicate that the {LLM}-generated solutions have higher average feasibility and usefulness while the crowdsourced solutions have more novelty. We experiment with prompt engineering and find that leveraging few-shot learning can lead to the generation of solutions that are more similar to the crowdsourced solutions. These findings provide insight into the quality of design solutions generated with {LLMs} and begins to evaluate prompt engineering techniques that could be leveraged by practitioners to generate higher-quality design solutions synergistically with {LLMs}.},
